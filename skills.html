                    I played hockey at the state level and reached the semi-finals. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt continue after 8th standard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    However, hockey has taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and endurance.
                </p>
                <p><strong>üèë Did you know?</strong> Field hockey is one of the oldest sports, dating back to ancient Egypt, where a similar game was played with a curved stick and a ball.</p>
                <p>
                    Hockey requires immense stamina, quick reflexes, and strategic thinking. Learning formations like **the 4-3-3 attack strategy** and **man-to-man marking** helped me sharpen my tactical skills.

            <div class="skill-card">
                
                <p> Madhubani painting is a traditional Indian folk art that originated in Bihar. The artwork is known for its vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and depictions of Hindu mythology. 
                    I have been practicing Madhubani painting for a long time and love incorporating its detailed style into my sketches.</p>
                    <p><strong>üé® Interesting Fact:</strong> Traditionally, Madhubani paintings were done on freshly plastered mud walls using natural colors extracted from plants and minerals.</p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from Madhubani, I also enjoy sketching landscapes, portraits, and conceptual art. Sketching helps improve creativity and focus, making it an important skill beyond just an artistic hobby.

                    I was a karate player and trained in martial arts, which helped me develop self-discipline, confidence, and physical fitness.
                    Karate is not just about fighting techniques but also about mental strength, focus, and respect.
                </p>
                <p><strong>ü•ã Did you know?</strong> Karate originated in Okinawa, Japan, and means ‚Äúempty hand‚Äù in Japanese, signifying fighting without weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    The belt ranking system in karate, from white to black, represents the progress of a student from a beginner to an expert. I have practiced various forms, including **Kata (forms)** and **Kumite (sparring)**.
